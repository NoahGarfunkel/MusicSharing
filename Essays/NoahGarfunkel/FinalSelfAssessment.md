My individual contribution to this project was 75% of the frontend for our application. This included setting up our Kotlin project in Android Studio, creating the Github repository, researching different technologies that we would eventually use, creating the login process to use the Spotify API, implementing the API using Retrofit that our frontend application uses to connect to the Spotify API as well as our backend. Additionally, I assisted in creating multiple screens that the user can interact with. I also developed the most essential part of the frontend, which is the ability to search and add tracks to a post. I built upon what I had started in the fall semester. Through this project, I gained confidence in making HTTP requests using Retrofit, connecting to the Spotify API, utilizing Kotlin, and employing Jetpack Compose. I believe this description adequately outlines both my contributions and the skills I acquired.
