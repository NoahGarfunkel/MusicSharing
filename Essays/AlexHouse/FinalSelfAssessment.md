I mainly worked on the back-end of our application and took on the role of lead back-end dev. My prior experience in web development greatly helped me plan and have a sense of what we needed to get a back-end API fully running. However, I have never actually gone through that process of setting up all the individual parts before, so this let me determine what our end goals would be we just had to figure out how to get there. Another area that I feel like I grew in was just my ability to lead a team. My other back-end dev was not as comfortable with our software and packages as I was which led to many teaching moments and explanations. This forced me to become a better teacher and leader so that I could know that he was understanding.
For the backend we developed a dotnet core 6 API that utilizes Entity Framework to query our cloud hosted Azure Database. Setting up all of this gave me a lot more confidence in understanding how all these parts are being accessed and working together to form a full API. I made myself even more comfortable in developing data secure entities and LINQ to access our database without SQL scripts. We had major success on the back-end of our application, where it was even farther developed than what we were able to implement on the front-end. One obstacle we faced was getting our database fully accessible by our back-end, and having our back-end accurately create models to map to the tables, but this was easily overcome.
