# Project Abstract

We have created a music sharing app with the integration of Spotify's API. This app is a new way to connect with friends and share your favorite songs effortlessly. You can create your own posts, add friends so that you can view their posts, view your customized profile, and login/sign out your authentication with your Spotify account.

Noah:

Throughout the semester I have made progress through research on android development and Jetpack Compose to create our frontend project and start work on the login screen. This work can also be seen in the front end repository.

Alex: 

I have mainly been focused on back-end primarily the research side. Working a lot with backend's designed in entity framework is helping me transfer my knowledge to our python stack but it is mainly taking research to find the best ways and practices to set it up. A lot of the physical work can be seen through the backend repository. The research doc below is just some of the research documented, as we started the doc late in the semester.
